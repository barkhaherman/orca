    <h2>Diet Information</h2>
    <p>Killer whales are top-level predators in the ocean. Killer whales are the
        largest predator of warm-blooded animals alive today.</p>
    <p>Globally, killer whales appear to have an extremely diverse diet. Yet,
        individual ecotypes or populations are often extremely specialized. In
        many parts of the world, killer whales prey on fishes or marine mammals,
        but not both.</p>
    <p>Worldwide, killer whales have been observed preying on more than 140
        species of animals, including many species of bony fish, sharks and
        rays, and 50 different species of marine mammals.</p>
    <p>Killer whales have also been reported to eat many other types of animals
        including leatherback sea turtles, dugongs, moose, and penguins and
        other seabirds.</p>
